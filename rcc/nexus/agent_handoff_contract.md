# Agent Handoff Contract

Current contract: **TAU-SCALING-SA v0.3.3e — Agent Contract Geometry Sync**

## Handoff Rule

An agent must leave the repository more navigable, not merely changed.

Before handoff, report:

```text
intent
shell
meridian
sector
files changed
validation run
evidence outputs
claim-boundary impact
failure lessons added
next safe action
```

## Required Final Gate

```powershell
python scripts/release/validate_release.py
python scripts/rcc/audit_readme_surface.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Non-Claim Lock

Agent handoff improves continuity and routing. It does not prove correctness, patch safety, AI understanding, silicon validation, product validation, or universal Tau Scaling law.
